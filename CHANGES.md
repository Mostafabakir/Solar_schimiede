# Solar Schmiede STM Adapter - Changes

## Issue Fixes and Improvements

This document outlines the changes made to fix the issues with data transmission between the STM32 and ESP32, as well as the implementation of new features for handling ADC values.

### 1. UART Data Handling Improvements

#### huart_task.c
- Reduced the task delay from 100ms to 5-10ms for more responsive UART data handling
- Added a flag to track when data is processed to optimize task scheduling
- Improved error handling and prioritization of UART data

### 2. SPI Communication Enhancements

#### bus_node.c
- Implemented proactive UART data checking in BusNode_RunLoop to ensure data is forwarded promptly
- Added proper CRC calculation for all packet headers to ensure data integrity
- Improved error handling in SPI transmissions with proper status checking
- Added timeouts and retries for more reliable communication
- Enhanced the forward_packet function with better error handling and timing
- Improved the detect_downstream function with better validation and error handling

### 3. ADC Reading Optimizations

#### main.c (adcReadTaskEntry)
- Implemented a more efficient ADC reading mechanism with proper timing
- Added a watchdog mechanism to restart ADC conversions if they stall
- Used static buffers to avoid stack issues
- Improved mutex handling for thread safety

#### main.c (adsTaskEntry)
- Optimized the external ADC reading process with proper timing
- Added small delays between channel readings to avoid SPI conflicts
- Implemented a more efficient update interval mechanism

### 4. Data Packet Handling Improvements

#### bus_node.c (handleUARTDataRequest, handleADCDataRequest, handleExternalADCDataRequest)
- Added proper queue count checking to avoid unnecessary processing
- Improved error handling and timeout management
- Added proper CRC calculation for all packets
- Enhanced packet structure with better organization and comments

### 5. General Improvements

- Added better comments throughout the code for maintainability
- Improved error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Optimized timing parameters for better performance
- Enhanced thread safety with proper mutex usage

## Testing

These changes should address the issues with slow or partial data transmission from the STM to the ESP32. The code now:

1. Processes UART data more promptly (every 5-10ms instead of 100ms)
2. Ensures ADC values are read and transmitted efficiently
3. Implements proper error handling and recovery mechanisms
4. Uses appropriate timeouts and retries for SPI communication
5. Ensures data integrity with proper CRC calculation

## Next Steps

1. Monitor the system performance after these changes
2. Verify that UART data is being received and forwarded promptly
3. Confirm that ADC values are being transmitted correctly
4. Consider further optimizations if needed
