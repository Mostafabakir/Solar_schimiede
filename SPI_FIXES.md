# SPI Connection Fixes

## Problem Analysis

After implementing the M-Bus data transmission improvements, the SPI connection was failing to establish. The following issues were identified:

1. **Packet Size Issues**: The increased packet size (from 32 to 256 bytes) was too large for the SPI hardware to handle reliably.

2. **Timing Issues**: The longer delays added for stability were actually causing timing problems with the SPI communication.

3. **Memory Usage**: The larger buffers were potentially causing memory issues on the STM32.

4. **Inefficient Transmission**: Sending maximum-sized packets regardless of actual data size was inefficient and potentially causing issues.

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Reduced Packet Sizes

- Reduced `PACKET_MAX_SIZE` from 256 to 64 bytes to avoid overwhelming the SPI hardware
- Reduced `UART_DATA_SIZE` from 250 to 32 bytes to use smaller chunks for transmission
- Implemented a streaming approach to handle larger M-Bus packets in smaller chunks

### 2. Optimized Timing Parameters

- Reduced delay times in SPI communications to avoid timing issues
- Shortened SPI timeouts to more appropriate values
- Added small delays between packet transmissions to allow for processing

### 3. Improved Memory Usage

- Used actual packet sizes instead of maximum sizes for all transmissions
- Implemented more efficient buffer management
- Added validation checks to prevent buffer overflows

### 4. Enhanced SPI Communication

- Modified all SPI functions to use actual packet sizes instead of maximum sizes
- Improved error handling and recovery in SPI communications
- Added header validation before receiving the rest of a packet

### 5. Streaming Approach for M-Bus Packets

- Implemented a streaming mechanism to break large M-Bus packets into smaller chunks
- Added flags to indicate when a chunk is the last part of a packet
- Maintained packet order and integrity across multiple transmissions

## Key Code Changes

1. **protocol.h**:
   - Reduced buffer sizes to more appropriate values
   - Added streaming-related definitions

2. **huart_task.c**:
   - Implemented a streaming mechanism for M-Bus packets
   - Added state tracking to handle multi-part packets

3. **bus_node.c**:
   - Modified all handler functions to use actual packet sizes
   - Improved SPI communication with better error handling
   - Added packet validation before transmission

## Expected Results

These changes should resolve the SPI connection issues while still maintaining the ability to handle large M-Bus packets:

1. The SPI connection should now establish reliably
2. M-Bus data will be transmitted in smaller chunks to avoid overwhelming the SPI hardware
3. The system will be more efficient by only transmitting the actual data needed
4. Error handling is improved to recover from communication issues

The STM32 now acts as a reliable bridge for M-Bus data, ensuring that complete packets from the meter are forwarded to the ESP32 without overwhelming the SPI hardware.
